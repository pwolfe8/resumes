AI/ML Embedded Edge Device work: Created and now manage team for GTRI Deepstream SDK custom product/codebase for enabling
users to custom tailor their video streaming machine learning architecture in the field at scale to include various features and easily
tweak settings. A quick list of some things I’ve done with Deepstream SDK: wrote gstreamer appsrc driver to publish GigE camera data
as a source into Deepstream, enabled parallel ML/tracker pipeline and video streaming, enabled streaming at different resolutions and
framerates than the ML/tracker pipeline, adding timestamp synchronization scripts to sync streams and recordings across multiple
devices, publish bounding box data to my server in a docker to forward them as ROS messages, integrating custom yolov4 into
tensorrt/deepstream pipeline (apparently someone made something for yolov5 just haven’t tested it out)
