Embedded Linux: realtime ML video acceleration with gstreamer + deepstream SDK. designed multitudes of video streaming architectures optimized for low latency \& acceptable accuracy. Setup Docker deployment to x86 \& ARM 
}
\newcommand{\experienceGTRIEdgeMLLong}{
    AI/ML Embedded Edge Computing: designed, implemented, \& maintained GTRI-wide Custom Deepstream SDK codebase + managed support team as the use-case grew across multiple contracts. This product allowed users to tailor a custom video streaming machine learning architecture in the field at scale to include various features and easily tweak desired settings. Quick list of some things I’ve done with Deepstream SDK:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item wrote gstreamer appsrc driver to publish GigE camera data as a source into Deepstream
        \item enabled parallel ML/tracker \& video streaming pipelines streaming at different resolutions and framerates 
        \item adding timestamp synchronization scripts to sync streams and recordings across multiple devices
        \item publish bounding box data to server in a container to forward them as ROS messages
        \item integrating custom yolov4 into tensorrt/deepstream pipeline alongside out of box models
        \item containerized on x86 and ARM with GPU pass-through
    \end{itemize}
    Projects I've used this for include: real-time video analytics for security \& surveillance, aerial \& ground based precision pointing systems
